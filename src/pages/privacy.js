<div class='text'>
	Keeping your information secure is very important to us and certain sections of the site may encrypt data using SSL or a comparable standard. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. As a result, whilst we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information which you send to us, and you do so at your own risk.

	Cookie Policy
</div>

<div class='text'>
	Most websites you visit will use cookies in order to improve your user experience by enabling that website to &#8217;remember&#8217; you, either for the duration of your visit (using a &#8217;session cookie&#8217;) or for repeat visits (using a &#8217;persistent cookie&#8217;). Some websites will also use cookies to enable them to target their advertising or marketing messages based, for parties not associated with the primary reason for data submission &#8211; See ICO guidance: &#8220;The GDPR sets a high standard for consent. But you often won&#8217;t need consent.&#8221; This can also be found in the EU legislation: Article 6 1(f) page 36 of REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL

<div class='subheading'>
	Legitimate Interest Justification
</div>

<div class='text'>
	The forms on our websites introduce a customer looking for the service in question. It is clear that contact details will be used by the Partner we connect them with in order to satisfy their request. Other than customer satisfaction calls no further marketing or processing will be conducted by Performance Leads. For this reason, we do not request or rely on &#8217;consent&#8217; as provided by opt in check boxes as the legal basis for data processing. This Opt in method is appropriate for Websites providing further data sharing with 3rd parties unrelated to the initial processing reason. For clarity if a Partner (Financial Advisor) is looking to provide &#8220;other&#8221; ongoing services to the customer or marketing to them beyond the initial reason for their enquiry, they will need to ensure they gain consent directly as part of their initial interaction with them.
